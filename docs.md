OYC

Short term goals
- better define flow and document the process at the beginning of the script
- example page
- investigate plugin system
- build script with minification
- add UMD insanity?
- See if we can improve initialization when used inside an ES Module. The problem is reading the on:click functions as they are no longer accessible

Long term goals

Self-imposed limitations
- modern JS wherever possible (fetch, intersection observer)
- package as a ES Module
- support attributes beginning with both `oyc` and `data-oyc`
- NO IE 11 Support
